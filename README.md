The popularity of Android has attracted attackers and hackers attention to itself as a good target for developing malicious applications.This unprecedented increase is often associated with the inherent openness of the Android platform, and the corresponding lack of security measures to prevent potential abuse. 

In this project, we proposed a model for android malware detection through authorship attribution. For each developer, a profile is created and trained. FastText Classifier is also utilized to train the model for the classification of the developers. During the test time, the unseen applications are first classified to the pre-recognized developers based on the coding style that is used in the application. If the application is predicted to belong to a malicious developer, the application is classified to be malware. Otherwise, it is a benign application. This presented model outperforms previous similar models in terms of accuracy and F-measure. The detailed results are available on the report.
